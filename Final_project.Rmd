 ## I eventually want the shiny app to run with the bins being the rounds and have the strokes gained per round be bars. In order to do that I have to make the graphs larger or I have to maybe narrow down the playrs to just the top 30 in the tournament or maybe even 20.

```{r}
# I plan on using the PGA Tour Shotlink Data in order to test how well strokes gained anticipates how well a player will do in a tournament. Even though this is what I am thinking right now, after looking at the data I might find that I am better served looking at something else in the data set and then I will observe that. Also, there is so much data that when I try to read it into R Studio, my computer basically crashes... so that is something I'll have to deal with going forward.
