## Unzipping the file that has the data in it

x <- read_excel("ThePlayers.xlsx") %>%
  clean_names()

## Reading in the data that I got out of the zip file as an excel sheet

x <- x %>%
  select(player_first_name, player_last_name, round, hole, strokes_gained_baseline, player_number) %>%
  group_by(player_last_name, round) %>%
  #filter(player_number %in% c(29221,26331,25632,48081,28089,25686,33141,37189,30911,29926,36689,33448,34563,24502,24138,8793,27349,29461,21961,26499)) %>%
  mutate(total_strokes_gained = sum(strokes_gained_baseline)) 

## I'm selecting the columns that I want to use and grouping by last name and round. I'm trying to find strokes gained data and all of the columns I have selected will help me pick out that data. I want to know the total strokes gained by round so I'm creating a new column using mutate and adding up all of the strokes_gained_baseline per round per player
  

write_rds(x, "finalproject.rds")

## I'm writing this new data set into and RDS file so that I can read it into the shiny app and have it in there
```

 ## I eventually want the shiny app to run with the bins being the rounds and have the strokes gained per round be bars. In order to do that I have to make the graphs larger or I have to maybe narrow down the playrs to just the top 30 in the tournament or maybe even 20.

```{r}
# I plan on using the PGA Tour Shotlink Data in order to test how well strokes gained anticipates how well a player will do in a tournament. Even though this is what I am thinking right now, after looking at the data I might find that I am better served looking at something else in the data set and then I will observe that. Also, there is so much data that when I try to read it into R Studio, my computer basically crashes... so that is something I'll have to deal with going forward.

##xx <- read_excel("Part of 2018 Data.xlsx")
